Here are some of the independent data analysis and visualization projects I have undertaken to explore and showcase my skills:

#### [1. Exploratory analysis and visualization of L&D survey data (records for 2018-2020 collected by Emerald Works UK) using Python.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SuzieP/Portfolio/blob/master/EmeraldWorks%20L%26D%20survey%20analysis%20and%20dashboard.ipynb)
###### The dataset

The dataset comes in an excel file provided by the L&D research organization EmeraldWorks and contains 3 yearsâ€™ worth of data collected from learning and development leaders and their organisational learning strategy.  In total there are 1697 rows of respondents and 293 variables in the dataset.

###### The analysis

I conducted an exploratory analysis of the survey results that unveiled the significance of Learning & Development strategies in organizational performance, the top L&D skills achieved and top L&D skills needed across 2018-2020 as well as the top L&D barriers across 2018-2020.

###### The results 

An interactive dashboard with the results of my analysis on plotly can be found [here](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~spap/7/ew-ld-data-2018-2020/)


#### [2. Exploratory quantitative analysis of the Chicago govt. public datasets (published in 2012) using SQL and Python.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SuzieP/Portfolio/blob/master/Chicago-%20school%2C%20socioeconomics%2C%20and%20crime.ipynb)
In this project I explored the relationships between the variables in three different datasets pulled from the Chicago government website: 
 1. Socioeconomic indicators in Chicago for each community area for years 2018-2012
 2. Chicago public school records for the 2011-2012 school year
 3. Chicago crime data from 2001 to 2012  

I conducted an exploratory correlation analysis between the following variables:
* per capita income
* hardship index
* crime count
* safety score
* college enrollment rates
* school misconduct rates

#### [3. Exploratory content analysis and WordCloud visualization of tweets relating to Donald Trump (scraped from Twitter Jan 5-8 2021) using Python.](https://github.com/SuzieP/Portfolio/blob/master/twitter-trump/twitter-trump.md)

In light of the Capitol Hill riots and the subsequent ban of Donald Trump's account on Twitter, I performed an exploratory analysis of all tweets that mention Donald Trump posted between January 5 to January 8 2021.  

I created a basic algorithm to calculate the 'newsworthiness' of each word on each day that increases with the frequency of that word on that day and decreases with the frequency of the same word on all other days.

The most newsworthy words surrounding Donald Trump on each day were then visualized through WordCloud art to create a visual story of the daily news as seen through Twitter.

#### [4. Exploratory analysis of citation network (public Citation dataset, 2010) using the Python PageRank algorithm.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SuzieP/Portfolio/blob/master/Citation%20Network%20with%20PageRank.ipynb) 

This is a collaborative project and an exploratory network analysis of this [Citation-Network V1](https://www.aminer.org/citation) containing research citation data for 629,814 papers and 632.752 citations. We wanted to generate the most important papers in this dataset according to how often it was referenced by other papers. So we built a network in which every node was a single paper and every edge was a reference to another paper. We ran the PageRank algorithm on a subgraph of the data to determine which nodes were the most important. We also explored some additional properties of the dataset such as weakly connected components and betweenness centrality to facilitate our understanding of the citation data. 

#### [5. Data visualization of Hollywood's most profitable stories (pulled from InformationisBeautiful for 2008-2011) using Tableau.](https://public.tableau.com/shared/9QZ9NR56C?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)
